 * Given an unordered list of objects that represent temperature readings from a high tech device, write a function "averageInRange" that receives the following arguments:
 *    - A start and end date to filter from
 *    - The list of temperature readings
 *
 * This function should return the average temperature between the start and end dates from the list of temperature readings
 *
 * averageInRange(startDate, endDate, readings) -> average
 *
 * Each temperature reading has the following structure:
 *
 * {
 *   value: Number,
 *   timeStamp: Date,
